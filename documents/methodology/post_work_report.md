# documents/methodology/post_work_report.md

## Purpose

Post-work reporting preserves auditability and makes it easy for the user to review correctness.

## When this applies (RAG triggers)

Use this when:
- Finishing a unit of work.
- Returning control after RELEASED work.
- After DIAGNOSIS completes and you are reporting findings.

## Report format

Include:
1) Work completed
2) Test status (pass/fail counts)
3) Commits made (list)
4) Squash recommendations (do not execute)
5) Outstanding issues / blockers
6) Next steps
7) Quality audit: why the work is correct, and what risks remain
